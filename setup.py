""" ++++++++++++++++++++++ Assistant modules +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 
No modules are required. If you don't want to use any additional features, then
you can change the following array to an empty one: 
    ENABLED_MODULES = []
    
If you disabled all modules then the assistant can only talk with you (= get_smart_answer). 
By this you can also easily add some modules to your project and place it here into the list. 
The more modules you have enabled the longer a potential answer of the bot might need. 

You can also create modules by your own. Just look into abstr_answer.py for a more detailed
documentation. When you created one you place your module files into the 'modules' package 
to keep the project structure clean and then just import it here and place it in the 
'ENABLED_MODULES'-array.
